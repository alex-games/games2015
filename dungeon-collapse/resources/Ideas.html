    <h3>Visuals</h3>
    <p>
        Can be anything from top-down to isometric.
        Style can be adjusted to story but needs to be clear (one view describes the situation, more or less)
    </p>
    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
        Robots mining?
        A wizards test?
        Dwarves digging?
        Alien dwarves in a digging competition?
        Two devils digging for hell?
        


    </p>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
        During your turn, each character can do 2 actions: pick twice from the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Wait</li>
            <li>Move</li>
            <li>Use Ability/Item</li>
        </ul>
        Each character takes up a point, and can move towards another point.
        Moving towards some tiletypes doesnt move the character but a special action happens. 
        Fx. a revelad point becomes unrevealed, the character attacks an enemy, the character tries to break a wall, the character uses a shop, etc.
        Attacking can only be done once per turn per character. 
        There are items/abilites that break any of these rules.

        The map is set up so that both players have the same board only mirrored, so the map is symetric. 
        This gives both players the same randomness, so it will be sort of fair.
        Also, you can use your own experience as info on what the opponent likely has collected,
        or even to move to 'their' space to collect a second same item, because you know the other side of the map.
        
        The difference between the players can be what type of characters they choose.
        Maybe there can be like one pedestal per character with an item that you can choose, 
        so you don't start with it, but you know you can collect it (and so can your opponent).

        We start with picking two characters and two items. Both players do this, and then the map is made and we start.
        The location of the items is mirrored (and randomized), each side contains the chosen items.
    </p>
    <h3>Items</h3>
    <p>
        Some tiles have items on them, you pick them up by moving on the tile.
        Some items just give you some upgrade and vanish.
        Other items you can hold and use as an ability.
        Example upgrades:
        <ul>
            <li>+10 health</li>
            <li>+4 attack</li>
            <li>Visual range +1</li>
            <li>Fire-resistance +2</li>
            <li>Health up doubles</li>
        </ul>


    </p>
    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    <p>
        Abilities can be charged or always usable.
        
        Example abilities:
        <ul>
            <li>Attack doubles this turn.</li>
            <li>Defense +50% for friendly characters (2 charges)</li>
            <li>No fire damage for 4 turns (1 charge)</li>
            <li>Deal 5 damage to every creature in this row/column except you</li>
        </ul>
       

    </p>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
        Different classes start out with different stats and different abilities. These should be the base for different play styles.
        Fighter: 20 attack, 15 defense, 50 health, ability: double attack next turn (3 charges)
        Tank: 10 attack, 20 defense, 70 health, upgrade: retaliation +50% damage, ability: Defense +50% for friendly characters.
        Mage: 10 attack, 15 defense, 40 health, ability: 5 damage to anyone in row, ability: 5 damage to anyone in column
    </p>
    <h3>Tiles</h3>
    <p>
        Tiles can be unrevealed, revealed or seen, seen shows all, revealed shows as it was when last seen.
         
        Tiles can be revealed to a player or not. Different types are:
        <ul>
            <li>Wall</li>
            <li>Basic empty</li>
            <li>Basic with item(s)</li>
            <li>Fire</li>
            <li>Water</li>            
        </ul>
        Standing on fire damages a character. Fire resistance helps negate that.
        Water is unpassable, can be filled or otherwise passed with abilites or upgrades.

    </p>

    <h3>Player stats</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Health</li>
            <li>Attack</li>
            <li>Defense</li>
            <li>Fire resisitance</li>
            <li>Upgrades</li>
            <li>Abilities</li>
            <li>Items</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>
        Kill the other player characters. Maybe another goal is to defeat the end boss, or have the most total health after x turns (to beat the idea of running until the other gives up)

    </p>
    <h3>Combat</h3>
    <p>
        Combat is done by moving into a square with an enemy on it.
        Combat can only be done once per turn.
        You deal your attack as damage, and then the enemy deals its attack to you.
        The amount of health you lose is based on the attack with your defense subtracted.
        Monsters don't attack, just retaliate.

    </p>
    <h3>PvP</h3>
    <p>
        

    </p>
    <h3>Monsters</h3>
    <p>
        Monsters can be on tiles and make it unpassable.
        They can be attacked and killed and have an item as treasure based on their level.

    </p>

<p>...</p>
<h3>Hunger games</h3>
<p>
    In the Hunger games mode two or more players will be randomly (or close to each other)
    spawned. After beginning players might move in one direction to escape the mass fight.
    Random weapons and power ups will spawned and players need to survive with what they can
    get their hands on. The last player alive will win the game.</p>
