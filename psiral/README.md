==========================

Psiral is a turn based strategy board game in which four wizards battle to reach the fountain of endless energy. This, of course, will bring them eternity and power beyond human imagination. Each wizard controls the powers of one of the four known elements, earth, water, fire and woodâ€¦ err, I mean air. Who will get to the fountain first? Choose and find out.
